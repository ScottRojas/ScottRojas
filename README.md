- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScottRojas
- 👀 I’m interested in making things connect up and work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning API development, intermediate-level Python and gaining a deeper awareness of library utilities for enterprise use cases, PostgreSQL, to make use of ML/AI applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enterprise interfaces, alternate frontends for business apps, blochain, and web3.
- 📫 How to reach me: PM me here or alternatively by email @ scott.mba.com
